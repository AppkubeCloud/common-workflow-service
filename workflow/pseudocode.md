### Common Logic For For All APIs

  1. Define a Lambda function handler that takes an event as a parameter.

  2. Import the PostgreSQL Client module.

  3. Create a new PostgreSQL Client instance database credentails.

  4. Attempt connection to database. Log success or error for the connection

  5. Parse request body data from the event object ( if there is a request body)

  6. Using the pg client create the SQL query required by the API in a try-catch block.

  7. On successfull query, return the data (if any) with a status code 200 and a success message.

  8. If there's an error during the database query, log the error and return a response with a status code 500 and a JSON body including an error message.

# Get the overview of projects

Retrieves the list of all the projects 

> Note: Filter by Status (Optional)

Method: GET

- Execute a SELECT query on the database based on the existence of the 'status' parameter.
      - If 'status' exists, filter projects by status.
      - If 'status' doesn't exist, retrieve all projects.

- Process the query result:
      - Initialize an empty object projectData to store processed project data.

- Iterate through each row in the result:
    - Extract project and usecase information.

    - Update projectData with the cumulative counts of total and completed tasks and usecases.

- Transform the projectData into a consistent structure.

# get no of completed and incomplete usecases for all projects between dates

Retrieves the list of all the Projects without filtering.

Method : GET

- Using the pg client create a SQL query using a WHERE clause to get a rows in the Projects table references project_id in the UseCases table.

# Add a new usecase to a project

Adds a new a usecase to a existing project

Method: Post

1. Start a database transaction.

2. Insert a new record into the usecases_table with project-related data.
   - Extract project_id, created_by_id, usecase_name, assigned_to_id, and description from the request.
   - Include additional usecase data like start_date, end_date, creation_date, status, and current_stage.
   - Retrieve the inserted data (usecase) with RETURNING *.

3. Fetch stages data from the projects_table based on the provided project_id.
   - Use a SELECT query to retrieve the 'stages' field from the 'project' JSONB column.

4. Prepare the stagesData for the usecases_table.
   - Create a stagesData object based on the fetched stages.
   - Map each stage to its respective assigne_id and checklists.

5. Update the usecases_table with the stagesData.
   - Use jsonb_set to update the 'stages' field in the usecase column.
   - Identify the record using its id (usecase_id).

6. Iterate through stages and tasks to insert data into the tasks_table.
   - For each stage, iterate through tasks and insert task data into tasks_table.
   - Include usecase_id, project_id, assignee_id, stage, and task details.
   - Use INSERT INTO queries within a loop.

7. Commit the database transaction.

# Get resources by role

Retrieves a list of resources based on the provided role

- Retrieve team data from the projects_table based on the project_id.

- Check if the specified team exists; return a 404 response if not.

- Check if the specified role exists in the team; return a 404 response if not.

- Retrieve resource IDs based on the specified team and role.

- Construct an SQL query to fetch resource data using the retrieved IDs.

- Add an optional filter based on the resourceName.

- Execute the SQL query to fetch resource data.

- Prepare the response with the fetched resource data.

``` SQL
